# P2P File Sharing System

## Overview
This project implements a simplified BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system using Python. It includes three main components:

- **Tracker**: Maintains metadata of shared files and a list of active seeders.
- **Seeder**: Shares a file, generates a .torrent, and registers with the Tracker.
- **Requester**: Loads the .torrent, queries the Tracker, and downloads the file from a Seeder.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Start the tracker (25 pts)

**Implementation**: The tracker is implemented using **Flask**, which listens for HTTP requests on `127.0.0.1:5001`. It handles two types of requests: Seeder registration and peer (Requester) queries.

**Result**: The Tracker successfully listens for connections, stores Seeder information, and returns the list of active Seeders upon request.

```bash
python tracker.py
```

**Expected output:**

### Step 2: Start the seeder (30 pts)

**Implementation**: The Seeder node takes a user-specified file, splits it into 1MB pieces, hashes each piece with SHA-1, and generates a `.torrent` file using **bencodepy**. The Seeder then registers the file information (info_hash and shared file list) with the Tracker.

**Result**: The Seeder successfully creates a `.torrent` file and registers with the Tracker. The file is placed in the `peer_6881/` folder, and the `.torrent` file is copied to the Requester's folder (`peer_6882/`).

 *(Note: The generation process may take a few seconds.)*

```
python seeder.py
```

**Expected output:**

### Step 3: Start the requester (35 pts)

**Implementation**: The Requester reads the `.torrent` file, extracts the `info_hash`, and queries the Tracker to get the list of active Seeders. It then downloads the file from one of the Seeders.

**Result**: The Requester successfully downloads the file from the Seeder and saves it in the `peer_6882/` folder.

``` 
python requester.py
```

**Expected output:**

## Implementation Summary

- **Tracker** is a Flask app that maintains `info_hash → list of seeders` mapping.

- **Seeder** reads a user-specified file, slices it, hashes it with SHA-1, and builds a `.torrent` file via `bencodepy`. It also registers itself with the Tracker.

- **Requester** reads the `.torrent` file, extracts the `info_hash`, queries the Tracker, and downloads the file via HTTP from a Seeder.

- File transfer and peer coordination were fully verified to work.
