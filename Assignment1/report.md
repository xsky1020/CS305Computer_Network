# P2P File Sharing System - Experiment Report

## System Overview
This project implements a simplified BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system using Python. It includes three main components:

- **Tracker**: Maintains metadata of shared files and a list of active seeders.
- **Seeder**: Shares a file, generates a .torrent, and registers with the Tracker.
- **Requester**: Loads the .torrent, queries the Tracker, and downloads the file from a Seeder.

## Project Structure

├── Tracker.py             # Tracker server (Flask)
├── Seeder.py              # Seeder peer (uploads file)
├── Requester.py           # Requester peer (downloads file)
├── example.txt            # File to be shared (user-specified)
├── example.txt.torrent    # Torrent file generated by Seeder
├── peer_6881/             # Seeder's shared folder
│   └── example.txt        # Copied shared file
├── peer_6882/             # Requester's folder
│   └── example.txt        # Downloaded file
└── report.md              # Report

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Start the tracker (25 pts)
```bash
python tracker.py
```

**Expected output:**

```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

### Step 2: Start the seeder (30 pts)

```
python seeder.py
```

**Prompt:**

Enter the file name to share :  (your_input)

**Expected output:**

``` 
.torrent file created: your_file.txt.torrent
.torrent file copied to requester folder
 Info hash: <hash_value>
 Successfully registered with tracker.
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:6881
```



### Step 3: Start the requester (35 pts)

``` 
python requester.py
```

**Prompt:**

Enter the path to the .torrent file: (peer_6882/your_file.txt.torrent)

**Expected output:**

``` 
 Retrieved info_hash: <info_hash_value>
 Found 1 seeder(s), starting download...
 Downloading your_file.txt from Seeder 127.0.0.1:6881
 File downloaded: your_file.txt, saved to: peer_6882/your_file.txt
```



## Implementation Summary

- **Tracker** is a Flask app that maintains `info_hash → list of seeders` mapping.

- **Seeder** reads a user-specified file, slices it, hashes it with SHA-1, and builds a `.torrent` file via `bencodepy`. It also registers itself with the Tracker.

- **Requester** reads the `.torrent` file, extracts the `info_hash`, queries the Tracker, and downloads the file via HTTP from a Seeder.

- File transfer and peer coordination were fully verified to work.
